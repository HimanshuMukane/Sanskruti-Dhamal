Summary
Did you notice something common between your most powerful
decisions and the simplest stories you remember?
They both share the same DNA: Trust. I believe my role is to earn
that trust by taking the most complex insights from AI and data and
packaging them into clear, honest strategies that inspire real change.
Storytelling is the superpower that turns potential into impact.
I specialize in translating Computer Engineering and Data Science
into strategies so clear, they make algorithms feel as engaging as
your favorite movie.
Proof of Impact & Strategic Acumen
The Power of One Message: I converted a single cold message into
a Principal Strategist (Founding Team) role at Curify. My mission
was simple: use smart, AI-driven strategy to help doctors build
influential brands and expand healthcare access.
Built for Global Leadership: I've been chosen for the McKinsey
Forward 2025 program and the prestigious Aspire Leaders Program
(Harvard University Initiative). These platforms confirmed my
capacity for critical thinking and ethical leadership on a world scale.
The Communication Catalyst: As a TEDx Core Member and a
certified master of storytelling (Think School), I specialize in the art of
"trading trust" through powerful, persuasive communication.
Let's Create Something Great:
I am actively seeking opportunities that demand the integration of
cutting-edge Data Strategy, AI-powered workflows, and world-class
communication. If you need an ambitious team member who can
simplify complexity, connect with an audience, and consistently
deliver high-quality results, I'm ready to collaborate.
